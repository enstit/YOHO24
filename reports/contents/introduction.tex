	\begin{frame}{Datasets}
	
		Common datasets for Audio Segmentation and Sound Event Detection problems are:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{TUT Sound Event Detection}: focuses on environmental sound detection. It primarily consists of street recordings with traffic and other activity, with audio examples of \SI{2.56}{\second}. It has six unique audio classes—Brakes Squeaking, Car, Children, Large Vehicle, People Speaking, and People Walking. The total size of the dataset is approximately \SI{1.5}{\hour};
			\item \textbf{Urban-SED}: purely synthetic dataset, with audio example of \SI{10}{\second}. It has ten unique audio classes -- Air Conditioner, Car Horn, Children Playing, Dog Bark, Drilling, Engine Idling, Gun Shot, Jackhammer, Siren, and Street Music. The total size of the dataset is about \SI{30}{\hour}.
		\end{itemize}
		
		An example of Urban-SED label is:\\
		\centerline{\texttt{[('gun\_shot', 0.3, 1.11), ('car\_horn', 0.31, 1.41)]}}
		meaning that an occurrence of gun shot is present from the \SI{0.3}{\second} to \SI{1.11}{\second}, and a car horn from \SI{0.31}{\second} to \SI{1.41}{\second}.
