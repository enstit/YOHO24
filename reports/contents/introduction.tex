	\begin{frame}{Datasets}
	
		Common datasets for Audio Segmentation and Sound Event Detection problems are:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{TUT Sound Event Detection}: primarily consists of street recordings with traffic and other activity, with audio examples of \SI{2.56}{\second} and a total size of approximately \SI{1.5}{\hour}. It has six unique audio classes -- Brakes Squeaking, Car, Children, Large Vehicle, People Speaking, and People Walking;
			\item \textbf{Urban-SED}: purely synthetic dataset, with audio example of \SI{10}{\second} and a total size of about \SI{30}{\hour}. It has ten unique audio classes -- Air Conditioner, Car Horn, Children Playing, Dog Bark, Drilling, Engine Idling, Gun Shot, Jackhammer, Siren, and Street Music.
		\end{itemize}
		
		An example of Urban-SED label is:\\
		\centerline{\texttt{[(gun\_shot, 0.3, 1.11), (car\_horn, 0.31, 1.41)]}}
		meaning that an occurrence of gun shot is present from the \SI{0.3}{\second} to \SI{1.11}{\second}, and a car horn from \SI{0.31}{\second} to \SI{1.41}{\second}.

		A popular toolbox for Polyphonic Sound Event Detection models evaluation is \textbf{SED Eval}\footcite{app6060162}.
